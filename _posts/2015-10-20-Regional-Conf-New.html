<h2>EWB Greater Austin participates in the South Central Regional Conference and wins Premier Chapter Award</h2>

<p>

This October, The Engineers without Borders-USA Greater Austin Chapter had 5 members attend the South Central Regional Conference. The Conference was hosted by the Texas A&M Chapter in College Station and brought together students and Professionals from chapters across Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Arkansas to network and share ideas. Anjan Contractor and Robert Read presented at the conference on the work that the Instrumentation and communications group has been conducting for our Panama, Peru, Guatemala and Local Latrine projects. The Greater Austin Chapter was also awarded the South Central Region Premier Chapter Award. Engineers without Borders-USA recognizes chapters that meet the ideals of a successful EWB-USA chapter. These ideals include excellence in organization, fundraising and public relations, engagement in mentor/mentee relationship and chapter and regional participation. Julie Jones, who presented the award, commended our chapter for its unique student/professional balance, Water Trotter Urban Challenge Fundraiser and involvement of members in both chapter board and regional positions.
