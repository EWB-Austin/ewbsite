<p>On July 8th, EWB-Greater Austin members presented a case study in climate change to students from Mexico as part of UT Austin's new Summer Engineering Development (SED) program.</p>
<p>The case study discussed the concept of climate change and its far-reaching global consequences, while also introducing students to EWB-GA's current irrigation project inÂ Huasta, Peru. After some initial background on the people, lifestyles and geography typical to Huasta, students were asked to examine and prioritize a variety of current issues faced by Peruvians which are related to climate change. During the discussion, EWB members provided unique insights based on their personal experience with the international development process. Particular emphasis was placed on cultural awareness, an understanding of the community's commitment to a project and the technical feasibility of each potential solution.</p>
<p>Ultimately, each team of students analyzed and presented their solution to one of the discussed issues. EWB members administering the case study also related the teams' proposals to actual decisions made by the EWB-GA Peru team on the project. The conversation between students and EWBers was incredibly creative, enthusiastic and informative. All in all, there was a lot of learning, laughs and pizza!</p>
