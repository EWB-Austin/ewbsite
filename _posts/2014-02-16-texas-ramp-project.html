<p>What better way to use our engineering skills than to build wheelchair ramps for disabled Austinites? They asked for 10, but 13 of us showed up for a morning of drilling, sanding and sawing. Thanks to the Texas Ramp Project's great planning and our enthusiasm and brawn, we got the ramp up and ready to go in 4 hours, and got invited back to help them out again! Good job, team!<br />
