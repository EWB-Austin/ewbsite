<p>On Saturday, Novenber 15th EWB-USA Greater Austin hosted our first golf tourney in support of the new Chacay치, Guatemala project! The event was a great success and funds raised from the event will go toward supporting our team as they travel to Guatemala for the assessment phase of their project in Spring 2015. You can learn more about the team's efforts in evaluating potable water supply solutions for the community of Chacay치 here.</p>
<p>Congratulations to our golf tournament winners!! Prizes were for lowest team score (Stubb's BBQ Sauce Gift Pack), longest drive (4 tickets to Round Rock Express), and closest to the pin (4 tickets to Texas Stars Hockey). </p>
<p>Approximately 32  people came out on the TeraVista Golf Club course to play, cheer and otherwise support the Chacay치 team! In addition to the good company, attendees enjoyed a fajita dinner and visited booths to learn more about EWB-USA Greater Austin's other projects. A tremendous thank you to everyone who attended and to all our donors! We hope to see you next year!</p>
