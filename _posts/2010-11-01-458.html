<div>I am Vice-President of the Construction Engineering and Project  Management Graduate Student Organization. We are currently hosting Gen.  Bud Ahearn (ret.) one of the founding sponsors and board member of EWB  for a lecture on "Civil Engineering Profession-Leadership in Motion".  The lecture will be <strong>November 11th at 1:30 PM in the Avaya Auditorium</strong> (ACE 2.302).</div>
<div></div>
<div>We thought that it would be of great interest to  your organization's member's to have the opportunity to attend. We will  be putting up posters around the engineering building next week.</div>
