<p>Probably the most used phrase on the trip! "Huincha" meaning "tape measure". Every time Milendes, our local "maestro de obras" or "construction manager" needed to measure something he would shout "Huincha! Huincha!" in desperation. Anyway, here are some pics of the travel team and the community members who helped build the system.</p>

We could not have built everything without their dedicated help! Pictured from left to right.
