<p>Next Saturday, September 29, 2012, the Greater Austin Chapter of Engineers Without Borders-USA will be volunteering at the <a href="http://www.watertothrive.org/content/events">Water to Thrive 5K</a> ! We will be supervising the Walk for Water which is a 25 yard path that volunteers will walk down back carrying a jerry can full of water. We will have a unique opportunity to talk to people about what it would be like to carry water like that for miles each day and some projects that help improve this situation. This will be our chance to talk about our Chapter's work and how our projects (spring boxes, distribution lines, sand filters, wells, etc.) can improve this situation. So come out and help us promote EWB-USA and raise money for clean water in Africa!</p>
<p>If you are interested in volunteering with EWB-USA Greater Austin, contact Haley Born at panama@ewbgreateraustin.org.</p>
