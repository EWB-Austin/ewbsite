<p>Today marks the end of the Peru Program's first Assessment Trip.  The assessment team visited two communities of the Tres Cuencas Commonwealth: Canrey Chico and Huasta.  In addition to signing the Program MOU, the team met with local researchers, scientists, professors, mayors, and community members to learn about water problems and potential first projects.   They look forward to sharing their findings, data, and pictures with the rest of the Peru Program Team and the EWB-AUS Board!</p>
