<p>Eweek 2015 is all about celebrating engineers. We're excited to announce the EWB-USA award winners this week, beginning with Professional Founders Award winner Tim Ager!</p>
<p>Tim is a model leader in the EWB-USA community. In his role as a professional mentor and EWB-USA Greater Austin Chapter president, he has built up the organization by encouraging and developing the next generation of leaders. </p>
<p>Tim has been hands-on in the completion of multiple EWB-USA projects, traveling eight times to work on three different programs. </p>
