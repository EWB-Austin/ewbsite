<p>Our volunteers in Peru are in great spirits and have made good progress on the assessment of the irrigation project. Here's a post we received a week ago from the travel team:</p>
<p>"Greetings from Peru. We have spent a couple of days here in Huaraz getting acclimated to the altitude and preparing project materials. We've been enjoying the beautiful views in the middle of the Andes mountains, and tomorrow we're heading into the project community of Huasta."</p>
