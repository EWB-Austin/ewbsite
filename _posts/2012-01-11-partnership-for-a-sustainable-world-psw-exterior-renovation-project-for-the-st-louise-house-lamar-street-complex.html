<p>Partnership for a Sustainable World (PSW) is currently helping the St. Louise House Lamar Street complex with an exterior renovation project.  Beginning in March, we're planning to build porches, install hardscaping, and complete landscaping and aesthetic improvements.   However, there is a severe drainage issue in the courtyards after a heavy rain.  The drainage issue needs to be resolved before the exterior aesthetic renovations can be constructed. PSW is looking for someone with a civil engineering or other similar background to help develop an approach for resolving the issue.</p>
<p>You can find more information about our nonprofit at <a href="http://www.partnershipforasustainableworld.org/" target="_blank">Partnership for a Sustainable World</a> and our project partner, the <a href="http://www.aiaaustin.org/committee/design-voice" target="_blank">AIA DesignVoice</a> committee.</p>
