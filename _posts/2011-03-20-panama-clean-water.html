<p>Congratulations to our Panama Clean Water and Health project for having two photos selected as winners in the  EWB-USA  International Conference Photo Contest!!</p>
<p>[gallery columns="2"]</p>
<p>One photo was selected in the  "Projects" category (the picture of the kids backfilling the trench) and a second was selected in the "People" category (the picture of the boys washing their  hands).  A total of 10 photos in each category were selected so this is quite an honor.  Out of all of EWB's projects EWB-AUS Panama was selected for not one but two categories!</p>
<p>All winning photographs will:</p>
<ul>
<li> Be printed and displayed at the EWB-USA 2011 International Conference</li>
<li>Be displayed at the EWB-USA Headquarters in Boulder, CO for the 2011 year</li>
<li>Be used in EWB-USA marketing and PR materials</li>
<li>Be given first preference for photograph requests by our Corporate Partners and the media</li>
</ul>
<p>Congratulations to the Panama project team!</p>
