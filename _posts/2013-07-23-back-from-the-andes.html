<p>Hi all! We just finished our first implementation trip in the small community of Huasta (~ 2,000 inhabitants). We set out to build a small scale sprinkler irrigation system for a community owned pasture. The typical irrigation method in this region is flood irrigation however this community has limited access to water thus a more efficient irrigation system was needed. During the trip we built two spring collection boxes, a break pressure tank and installed approximately 1,200 meters of PVC pipe. In January, our team hopes to return to Huasta to install the sprinklers in the pasture however water is currently flowing to the field if the community wants to use the water in the meantime. Below are a few pics but more will follow. Thank you all for the support! Stay tuned for a complete update in the coming month.</p>
<p>Be sure to wish the Panama travel team good luck on their upcoming implementation trip in Sieykin. They leave in a couple of weeks!</p>
