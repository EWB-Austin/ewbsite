<p>TSPE is partnering with the Central Texas Discover Engineering organization which pairs up engineers with schools and takes care of all the logistics. We will have some of the activities at this meeting to help us understand what we will actually be doing with the kids.  We will be signing people up for school visits so don’t miss this opportunity!</p>
<p>The Travis Chapter of TSPE is pleased to welcome Lonny Stern with SkillPoint Alliance to our January luncheon. Mr. Stern's presentation entitled "Changing the Conversation" will examine how we can impact the future of the engineering field by engaging students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) subjects.</p>
<p>Mr. Stern will provide helpful tips about the best (and worst) ways to talk to students about the engineering field. Additionally, we will see results from demographic studies showing who is studying engineering now and what students say about studying engineering in the future.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you there!</p>
