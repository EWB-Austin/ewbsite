On July 31st Farmshare Austin will host its second annual Farm Raiser at the historic Saengerrunde Hall in downtown Austin. The event will feature square dancing (with lessons first!) and live music from the Barn Owls, BBQ from Tony Grasso and Moontower Coop, local vegan and vegetarian delights, and craft beverages. Proceeds will go towards Farmshare's projects locally including our Composting Toilet project.
