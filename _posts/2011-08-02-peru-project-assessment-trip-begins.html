<p>The first assessment trip for the <a title="Peru – Tres Cuencas Commonwealth" href="http://ewbgreateraustin.org/projects/peru/">Peru Project</a> with the Tres Cuencas Commonwealth has officially begun.  This project brings together EWB-AUS and <a href="http://www.mountain.org" target="_blank">The Mountain Institute</a> to work together with several rural Andean communities (represented by the Tres Cuencas Commonwealth) in Ancash, Peru, to mitigate water challenges due to climate change.  On this first assessment trip, the EWB-AUS team will be visiting the communities, assessing project feasibility, and beginning work on a memorandum of understanding.</p>
<p>This assessment trip will end on August 15.  Check back for more updates and pictures!</p>
