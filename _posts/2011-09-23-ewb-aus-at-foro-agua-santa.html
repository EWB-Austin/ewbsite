<p>Long-term volunteers James Seppi and Taylor Cook represented the EWB-AUS Peru Program at the Foro Agua Santa 2011 held in Huaraz, Anchash, Peru on September 22 and 23. The forum was a venue for water users at all levels of the Santa River Basin, from the peaks to the coast, to share their concerns and ideas about how to implement integrated management of this important resource.</p>
<p>Taylor and James met with forum attendees and handed out information to promote the Peru Program.</p>
