<h1>Weekly Meetings Begin and a Friday Social</h1>

<p>
Our first weekly Peru, Instrumentation and Local Projects meeting of the semester is this coming Monday, September 21, at 6:00pm in our rooms rented from the McCord Community Center of Austin Presbyterian Seminary,
 see the map below.  
Come help us get the new semester underway!

<p>
There's also a few officer positions we're looking to fill, including Technology Chair and Membership Chair, so let us know if you're interested.

<p>
Additionally, we're having our first social event of the semester this Friday, September 18, at Pease Park.  We'll just be hanging out, getting to know one another outside of Project meetings. 
 We'll have drinks, snacks, games and activities, so come get to know your fellow EWBers!
