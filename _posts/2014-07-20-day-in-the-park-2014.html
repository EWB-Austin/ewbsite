<p>EWB – Greater Austin friends and family celebrated the summer at our annual Day at the Park event on Sunday, July 20th in Zilker Park. It was one of those great Texas summer afternoons where the sunshine melts onto your skin and you get to kick back &amp; relax. We had a great turnout, with lots of people bringing snacks and beverages of their choice. EWB-GA provided the fajitas, tortillas, and typical Tex-Mex sides. Props to our very own Grill Master, Paul H. for the expertly grilled fajita meat!</p>
<p>For the most part, the heat kept everyone tranquil, but a few of the more adventurous EWBers played Frisbee and ran around with our furry four-legged friends. It was awesome getting to know a few of the EWB folks better, outside of meetings, and to meet everyone's friends &amp; pets. If you weren’t able to join us this time, don't worry- there are other events upcoming! Be sure to check the calendar for them. :)</p>
