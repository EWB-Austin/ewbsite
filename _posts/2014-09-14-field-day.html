<p>It's been a busy start of the fall semester for the Greater Austin Chapter of EWB-USA! We've had our general meeting (with an excellent presentation by Dr. Jay Banner), kickoffs for weekly project meetings, and this past Sunday we had our very first Field Day at Eastwoods Park. All in a single week!</p>
<p>For Field Day we competed in several sporting events including egg-and-spoon relay races and a miniature urban scavenger hunt. The mini scavenger hunt was focused just around the UT Austin campus and was a fun way to learn more about our annual Water Trotters event. Congratulations to the winning teams of each event and thank you to everyone who was able to attend the event! Check the website and calendar regularly for other socials.</p>
