<p>Come join us for our first meeting of the 2014 fall semester! <strong><span style="color: #3f77c0;">The general meeting is on Monday, September 8th, from 6:30 -8:00 pm in CPE Room #2.208 on the UT campus. </span></strong>For those of us less familiar with the area, CPE is the Chemical &amp; Petroleum Engineering Building. (See link for directions: <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/maps/main/buildings/cpe.html">http://www.utex​as.edu/maps/mai​n/buildings/cpe​.html</a>)</p>
<p>Dr. Jay Banner with the UT Jackson School of Geosciences will be presenting on "Past, Present, and Future Climate Change in Texas; Science, Impacts and Policy". Dr. Banner is a professor in the Department of Geological Sciences and also serves as the Director of the Environmental Science Institute. <strong><span style="color: #3f77c0;">For our professional members, this presentation will qualify as one PDH towards your annual Continuing Education.</span>  </strong>Light refreshments will be provided.</p>
<p>We will also be talking about our two newest projects in the Greater Austin Chapter: the Chacayá, Guatemala water project and our Instrumentation program. All of our projects are collaborative efforts supported by both students and professionals with varying levels of knowledge and expertise. <strong><span style="color: #3f77c0;">You do not have to be an engineer to join! </span></strong>The general meeting is an excellent opportunity to learn more about ways to get involved and meet our Board members for the upcoming year. There are a lot of exciting things happening in the Chapter and we look forward to seeing you at the meeting!!</p>
