<p><strong><em>Assessment Trip I (January 2009)<br />
</em></strong></p>
<p>The Greater Austin Chapter of EWB-USA  first traveled to Sieykin in January, 2009. The principal goal of this assessment trip was to become familiar with the community and to determine if Sieykin’s residents were interested in partnering with Greater Austin for a community development project. With the help of several community members, the group conducted basic topological surveys, water tests of the sources and household interviews. After consulting with the people of Sieykin, Greater Austin members decided that water treatment and hygiene education would constitute the first phase of the program in Panama. It was also decided that the pilot system will be implemented in the Centro sector where the school and clinic are located.</p>
<p><strong><em>Assessment Trip II (August 2009)<br />
</em></strong></p>
<p>In August 2009, another team of seven students and a professional mentor conducted the second assessment of Sieykin. Tasks completed on the trip included water testing, land surveying, a materials availability survey, a community health assessment and an assessment of appropriate technology for a water supply system. In meetings with the newly elected water committee and other community leaders, the group discussed the project plans and established the roles and responsibilities of EWB-USA, the water committee, and other community members.  Greater Austin members also launched a health education campaign to explain the process of disease transmission, the connection between the community’s water quality and health problems, and the importance of handwashing. The group also met with a local Rotary Club, other NGOs, and the Panamanian Ministry of Health to discuss future collaboration and partnership.</p>
<p><strong><em>Implementation Trip I (July/August 2010)<br />
</em></strong></p>
<p>This trip marked the beginning of the implementation phase of the Panama water project of EWB-USA Greater Austin. The primary goals of the trip were to install a potable water system, improve the community’s current water system (to serve as a non-potable system), and continue with health and system maintenance education efforts. The dual potable/non-potable water system now serves the central sector of the community, where the school, health post, church, and about 30 households are located.</p>
<p>The trip, 8 weeks in total, was divided into 4 parts: Materials Procurement<strong> </strong>(1 week; 2 EWB members), Group I and Group II (each 3 weeks; 7-9 EWB members), and a brief interim period between Groups I and II (1 week; 5 EWB members). Three EWB members (including two project leads and a professional) stayed for 7-8 weeks to ensure project continuity.</p>
<p>During the trip, for the potable water system, the Greater Ausin group and community constructed a spring box for clean water capture and a 5,000 L potable water storage tank using poured concrete construction. They also laid about 5450 ft of piping from the spring box to the potable tank and from the tank to the community center. For the non-potable system, the Greater Austin group and community installed about 3300 ft of piping from the non-potable water source to the current water tank and from the tank to the community center. The piping was buried or encased in larger PVC pipe to protect it from UV damage. Valve and air release boxes were installed as necessary, as well as small bridges when crossing ravines or particularly uneven terrain.</p>
<p>Greater Austin group members taught health education in the local primary school through role play, activity books, songs, and visual tools (including a microscope). Meetings were held with community members every week to discuss progress, work and food preparation for the upcoming week, and any project concerns. The final meetings focused more on leadership and completion of the project after the EWB group returned home.</p>
<p>The  group encountered many obstacles during the trip, including difficult working conditions and inconsistent community participation. However, many of these obstacles were overcome through open, honest communication and learning to draw on the unique strengths of the EWB group and community members.</p>
<p><strong><em>Assessment Trip III (January 2011)<br />
</em></strong></p>
<p>This purpose of this assessment trip was to monitor and assess the first phase of implementation, to initiate the second phase of implementation for the Greater Austin’s Panama Program, and continue the health education campaign in Sieykin.  The Greater Austin travel team spent 10 days in the community.  During this time, the team split into two groups.  Although there was some cross-over, half the team focused primarily on health education and community relations, while the second half focused on the technical aspects of the project.</p>
<p>The health education group conducted household interviews.  The main purpose of these interviews was to assess the community’s satisfaction with the first phase of implementation, assess how the new system was working, and discuss any changes in the health of each household.   They also educate the community about the water system and EWB’s continued presence in the community for the duration of the program. They also met with the water committees to discuss their roles and to guide them into becoming better functioning committees.</p>
<p>With the assistance of community members, the technical group located potential spring sources, tested them for water quality, and surveyed the area to provide elevation and distance information for the water distribution line.  They also inspected the first phase of implementation and worked with the community to troubleshoot some problems they have had with the system.</p>
<p><strong><em>Implementation Trip II (July 2011)</em></strong></p>
<p>In July 2011, the Greater Austin Chapter commenced the second phase of implementation in Sieykin, in the sector known as Sieykin Arriba.  Since the last assessment trip, the team learned that the spring identified to provide water to the Arriba sector was not producing the necessary volume of water to build the system as designed.  The goals for this trip were modified to be: constructing the bridge pediments for the aerial crossings, further assessing potential water sources for Arriba, discussing possible water treatment options with the community, monitoring the system built in El Centro in 2010, and continuing health education activities.</p>
<p>The main tasks in this trip included procuring materials, delivering materials to the community, collecting aggregate from the creek shore, transporting sacks of sand and aggregate to the pediment sites, excavating for bridge pediments, constructing the rebar cages, hand-mixing concrete, and assembling the bridge pediments.  In addition, the team reassessed the local water source, Ojo Norte, and concluded it would not be an adequate source to provide clean water to Sieykin Arriba.</p>
<p><strong><em>Assessment Trip IV (January 2012)</em></strong></p>
<p>During Assessment IV, the team presented different options for ensuring the homes in Sieykin Arriba had access to potable water.  Since no suitable springs were found to build a system similar to that in El Centro, the team decided it made more sense to divide Arriba into two areas, Arriba Alto and Arriba Bajo.  Arriba Alto includes the households at a higher elevation and greater distance away from the original spring source.  Arriba Bajo are the homes that already have access to a distribution system of non-potable water.  The team worked with the community to build a pilot biosand filter that could be used as a point-of-use treatment system to provide potable water to each household.  They also discussed the potential use of chlorination as a treatment option.  Other objectives of the trip included assessing springs that could potentially serve as a source for the households in Arriba Altoand continuing to monitor the water distribution and storage system built in El Centro.</p>
<p><strong><em>Implementation Trip III (July 2012)</em></strong></p>
<p>In July 2012 the second phase of implementation in Sieykin Arriba continued. Since the success of the biosand filter had not yet been fully tested, a full scale implementation could not be carried out during this trip.  However, some tasks concerning the existing distribution system could be addressed while assessing the biosand filter and maintaining contact with the community. The goals for this trip were to transfer the aerial crossings onto the reinforced concrete pediments, assess the biosand filter constructed in January 2012, monitor the system implemented in Centro in 2010, and continue the health education campaign.</p>
<p>The primary technical task on this trip was to transfer two existing aerial crossings from tree anchors to the permanent concrete pediments constructed in July 2011.  New 3/16” cable was used as well as new 1.5” PVC pipe that was painted for UV protection.  A new intake filter was also created to help minimize the frequency of the intake clogging due to debris in the stream and two shut-off valves were installed to improve the community’s ability to perform maintenance.</p>
<p>The assessment of the sand filter was less successful. The water tests performed on the filter influent, effluent, and stored water were inconclusive. We suspect the 3M Petrifilms used to perform E coli and total coliform tests were somehow compromised. Out of all of the tests performed only two Petrifilms showed any signs of coliform growth.</p>
<p>Extensive house-to-house questionnaires were performed in both Arriba Bajo and Arriba Alto.  These questionnaires served to increase the team’s knowledge about this part of the community including information about their household structures, water usage habits, and main water sources. The high elevation of the houses in Arriba Alto relative to their sources of water will make one congruous, gravity fed system difficult to implement, but a more piece-meal approach to transporting the water to the houses may still be possible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Assessment Trip V (January 2013)</em></strong></p>
<p>A team travelled to Sieykin January 2013 with the primary purpose of assessing the sand filter and monitoring past implemented projects.  Overall, the trip was a success.  The water quality data from the sand filter clearly indicated it is providing potable water.  All tests of the influent water were positive for E. coli, and all of the tests on the effluent water were negative!  This was great news.  The community also reported that the new water intake filter had significantly decreased the amount of clogging of the distribution system.  We helped install a clean out valve to make it easier to clean out the fine sand and silt that still gets into the system.  They were also very pleased with the new aerial crossings, reporting that they have not had to fix any breaks in the line since the system was improved.</p>
