<p>We are the Greater Austin chapter of Engineers Without Borders â€“ USA (EWB-USA). EWB-USA is a nonprofit humanitarian organization established to support community-driven development programs worldwide through partnerships that design and implement sustainable engineering projects, while creating transformative experiences that enrich global perspectives and create responsible leaders.</p>
<p>The Greater Austin chapter of EWB-USA was formed by merging The University of Texas at Austin student and Central Texas Professional chapters in the summer of 2009. Our new chapter is larger and more diverse and allows for better collaboration across the experience spectrum. The passion, drive and inquisitiveness of our younger members combined with the technical and project management experience of our more tenured members creates tremendous momentum that ensures we make a positive, lasting impact on our partner communities.</p>
<p>The Greater Austin chapter is dedicated to providing life quality improvements to communities in need via the implementation of simple engineering technologies. While we improve the standard of living for communities abroad, we foster the development of future professionals from myriad academic and professional disciplines. Our projects tend toward water, renewable resources, and community health, requiring the insight and knowledge of students and professionals from many fields.</p>
<p>There is plenty going on in the Greater Austin chapter of EWB-USA. So whether you can commit a couple hours a month locally or a couple weeks abroad, join us at our next general meeting (or happy hour) to learn more.</p>
