<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What We're Doing</strong></span><br />
The community of Chacayá, in the Department of Sololá, sits at the base of Volcán San Pedro on the western shore of Lago Atitlán in Guatemala. It is a Tz’tujil Mayan community of approximately 1,000 residents. The residents of Chacayá currently obtain their drinking water from the lake, utilizing filtration, chlorination, and boiling for primary treatment. Water-borne parasites persist as a chronic problem in the community, and recent cyanobacteria blooms have triggered an advisory for communities to seek alternative water sources.</p>

<p>The program will consist of evaluating water supply options available to the community of Chacayá and providing the most appropriate solution(s) based on technical, economic, and political feasibility. Treatment options for the lake water and availability and quality of well water will be assessed before studying hydrology and feasibility of a new caldera-fed water supply system.</p>
