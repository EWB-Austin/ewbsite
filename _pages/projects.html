<h2>Sieykin, Panama</h2>
<p>Among the smallest and most impoverished indigenous groups in Panama, the Naso people number approximately 3,300 and are spread across eleven communities in the Bocas del Toro region of northwest Panama.  EWB-AUS has partnered with the community of Sieykin, which has a population of 400 people.  This project will support Naso self-sustenance through the improvement of their local infrastructure.</p>
<p>Through individual household interviews and community-wide meetings, we decided the principal objective of the project would be to reduce waterborne diseases by providing the community with potable drinking water, a reliable water distribution/storage system, health education, and eventually a safe sanitation infrastructure.</p>

<h2>CAMBIAR - Climate Adaptation in Mountain Basins in the Andean Region (Ancash, Peru)</h2>
<p>With the highest density of tropical glaciers on the Earth, Peru is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change; only 2% of the country’s water resources are stored where 70% of the population resides. In recent decades, these sources of fresh water have become less dependable and many of the rural communities have experienced water shortages during the dry season. The impacts of these shortages have been felt most acutely by farmers and ranchers in the region who have noticed changes in crop yields and struggled to maintain adequate pasture land.  We have partnered with rural communities in the Ancash region of Peru to address imminent water and climate related adaptation issues.</p>

<h2>Chacaya, Guatemala</h2>
<p>The town of Chacayá, on the western shore of Lake Atitlán in Guatemala, currently confronts a significant public health risk. Historically the community of 1,000 Tz’tujil Mayans has drawn its drinking water directly from the lake, but the deterioration of the lake’s water quality has led to an increase in gastrointestinal infections. Complicating matters further, a series of massive cyanobacterial blooms on the lake beginning in 2009 have raised concerns about the community's exposure to potentially deadly cyanotoxins. The community has requested new water supply project from the top of a volcano. We will be taking our first Assessment Trip in February 2015 to meet with stakeholders and collect information about current potable water situation.</p>

<h2>Instrumentation Group</h2>
<p>Currently working with Panama, Peru, and Guatemala to provide cost effective, simple, compact and contemporary solutions for the instrumentation needs of each project. Working to develop instruments using Open-source platform and a portal to share designs, fabrication methods and manuals.</p>

<h2>Jaboncillos Chicos, Mexico - Completed</h2>
<p>Jaboncillos Chicos is a small community located in the Coahuila Desert, 25 miles south of Big Bend National Park. The community has limited access to clean water and had to truck in water from a nearby mountain spring. We have implemented a water distribution system involving underground piping and a solar-powered submersible pump that distributes potable water from the borehole to faucets at each home as well as to a storage tank. This was EWB-UT's first completed project.</p>
