<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Executive Summary</strong></span><br />
The Greater Austin Chapter of Engineers Without Borders (EWB-USA), through its Climate Adaptation in Mountain Basins in the Andean Region (CAMBIAR) program has partnered with rural communities in the Ancash region of Peru to address imminent water and climate related adaptation issues. With the highest density of tropical glaciers on the Earth, Peru is extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change; only 2% of the country’s water resources are stored where 70% of the population resides. In recent decades, these sources of fresh water have become less dependable and many of the rural communities have experienced water shortages during the dry season. The impacts of these shortages have been felt most acutely by farmers and ranchers in the region who have noticed changes in crop yields and struggled to maintain adequate pasture land.</p>

<p>As a proactive response, 25 municipal districts in the Ancash region have formed the Tres Cuencas Commonwealth for the sole purpose of mitigating water and climate issues within the three watersheds (<em>cuencas</em>) that feed the region. The Commonwealth and CAMBIAR program have signed a formal agreement to work together on collaborative community-scale projects to adapt to water-related climate change challenges. Greater Austin has partnered with The Mountain Institute (TMI), an international NGO on the ground in Peru, to implement new technologies and conservation practices that address water and climate issues in the Commonwealth. Greater Austin is contributing to these projects by: (1) providing technical support for communities to further assess and prioritize their needs, (2) collaborating with communities to design and implement sustainable technical solutions, (3) training communities to conduct maintenance and repairs, (4) educating community members on health and societal benefits of the system, and (5) monitoring long-term project status.</p>

<p>The CAMBIAR program is currently helping Huasta, a municipal district within the Commonwealth, with a project relating to the limited availability of water for the irrigation of grazing pastures, a result of hydraulic limitations of existing irrigation infrastructure. The CAMBIAR program has discovered alternate sources of irrigation water and built a functional irrigation system in a large communal plot of land to allow local ranchers to expand their herds, and in turn, produce dairy products, an important source of income for the community. The CAMBIAR program is focused on outreach to the greater Huasta community to educate on the effects of climate change and the need to practice water conservation, as well as training on how to operate and maintain the new irrigation system</p>

<p>The CAMBIAR program has completed several assessment and implementation trips in Huasta to build relationships with key community members, gather data to design irrigation infrastructure, and construct the irrigation system. The Greater Austin team will return to the community in the summer of 2015 to monitor the status of the irrgation system and explore community project options in neighboring areas. Through pilot projects like this in Huasta, the CAMBIAR program will build local adaptation capacity, community resilience to changes in the environment, and promote a sustainable model for technical community-based development projects.</p>
