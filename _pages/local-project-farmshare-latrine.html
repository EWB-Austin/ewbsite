<p><strong>Current Project:</strong> Composting Latrine with Farmshare Austin</p>
<p><strong>Current Project Lead: </strong>Michelle Arsjad</p>
<p>Farmshare Austin operates an organic farm in the area around Austin, Texas.  Their mission is to educate the next generation of organic vegetable growers in Central Texas and provide fresh produce to low-income and access-challenged residents of the community.  Their existing septic system cannot sustain the fulltime Farmshare crew as well as the students who live on the farm during the 6 month long classes, and so they reached out to EWB-USA Greater Austin for help finding a solution.</p>
<p>A Composting Latrine would be convenient for composting at the organic farm, and many of the operational and maintenance challenges usually associated with this type of latrine can be managed due to the small number of well informed and trained individuals using the latrine on a daily basis.  We are currently on track to have all the necessary research and design completed in time to begin construction in September 2015.</p>
