<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">The Greater Austin Chapter of EWB-USA, in concert with the </span><a style="line-height: normal;" href="http://www.rotary5840.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #e41500;">Rotary District 5840</span></strong></a><strong style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"> Hunger Plus Committee of San Antonio</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">, has undertook a plan to install sustainable internet-enabled computers in the schools of several <em>ejidos</em> (rural communities) in the northern Mexican state of Coahuila.

<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Project Details</span></strong></p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Greater Austin began its commitment to this region in March 2006 with its first project, a water distribution system in the <em>ejido</em> of Jaboncillos Chico. Jaboncillos Chico is a smaller town of about 40 people, and is only a few miles away from San Miguel. The people in Jaboncillos Chico will thus be able to use and benefit from the systems installed in San Miguel. The final implementation of the water distribution system was done in August 2008. The Rotary Club of San Antonio is also committed to Coahuila, providing food and gifts to children and pursuing various projects, including this computer project.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">The <em>ejidos</em> are in the district of Ocampo, in northern Coahuila, which borders Texas along Big Bend National Park. San Miguel is 25 miles from Big Bend. Each of the towns has a population in the hundreds. The climate is desert, and many of the people in the region earn their livelihood by selling candelilla wax to the government – a difficult, labor intensive job that earns about 50 U.S. dollars a week.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: normal;"><a name="TOC-Satellite-Internet-Access"></a><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Greater Austin installed three satellite internet-connected computers in the community center of San Miguel in January 2010.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"> Since the <em>ejidos</em> are not connected to the power grid, all of the energy is supplied through sustainable (solar) sources. The goal is for the town to eventually take ownership of the system, by charging the adults in the communities a small fee to use the computers, while allowing the children to use them for free. A similar pay-as-you-go system for agricultural equipment has proved to be successful in this region in the past. To minimize these costs, EWB-USA used components that have low-power consumption, maintainability, and flexibility.</span></p>
